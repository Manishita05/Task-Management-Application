1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.

This project is provided without the node_modules folder, so you'll need to install all the dependencies yourself. Follow these steps to install the dependencies:
Open your command line interface.
Navigate to the following directories:
```/frontend/task-manager-app/```
```/backend``
3. Run the following command in each directory to install the dependencies:
```npm install``` 
Starting the Application
4. After installing all the dependencies, you can start the application. Run the following command in both directories (/frontend/task-manager-app/ and /backend):
```npm start``` 
Your application should now be up and running.
